FINAL PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS

Please put on your earphones - my friend made some pretty awesome music for this game.
Ok, so the graphics aren't ideal - I decided not to use any sprites for the towers because I couldn't find anything nice enough that would fit well into the game.

See the instructions in the menu screen.

Scroll using arrow keys/mouse/scroll arrows at side of screen
Zoom in/out using mouse wheel
The tower panel is on the right -- click on a box (representing a tower) and place it on one of the grid squares. If its not valid (eg you don't have enough cash/tile is full), you won't be able to place it there. 
When you move your mouse over a box on the tower panel, the description of the tower will show.
You can only build a maximum of 5 gold towers - if any gold towers are destroyed, that's too bad, your limit won't reset.

Enemies spawn and make their way towards the barracks in the center. Once they touch it, you lose.
After round 15 or so, some enemies explode - there will be a bar above them that appears once their timer has 10 seconds or less left on it. If you kill an exploding enemy, you get 3 points instead of 1 for killing regular enemies.

Adaptive difficulty means that the enemies will have more HP the faster you kill them.
